Parameter list
--------------

The param class should have the following parameters as members:
    Tau_slow
    Tau_fast
    tauG
    deltaG
    NSMAX
    NFMAX
    pRefS
    pRefF
    nuMF_mean
    nuMF_sd

We will use two vescicle pools, one is typically fast and the other slow with
time constants (same for all MF tipes)
    
Tau_slow=2.0		
Tau_fast=20.0/1000.0

// desensitization time scale and gain (will see if we want to use it)
tauG=100.0/1000.0
deltaG=0.1

All the other parameters depend on the MF class. Here we assume we have two
classes called drivers [D] and supporters [S]

For the driver class we have

NSMAX=3.5  // N max in the driver slow pool 
pS0=0.8 // Initial release probability of the driver slow pool
pRefS=0.6 // recovery probability of the driver slow pool

NFMAX=14 // same as the 3 lines above but for the fast pool
pF0=0.6
pRefF=0


for the supporter type of MF we have

NSMAX=4  
pS0=0.4
pRefS=0.6

NFMAX=6
pF0=0.2
pRefF=0
